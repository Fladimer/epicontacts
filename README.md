# Handling, visualising and analysing contact data during outbreaks


## What we want to do
* get data in from  reported contact lists (=edges and edge attributes) and line lists (=nodes attributes)
* visualise network
* handle directionality
* visualise node metadata
* visualise edge metadata
* visualise data as time-constrained graph
* subset by node metadata
* subset by edge metadata
* analysis: degree distribution, centrality, lengths of chains, other descriptors of networks


## Existing tools
* Neo4J and RNeo4J
* visNetwork
* igraph
* networkD3
* ggnetwork
* network
* networkDynamic
* muxViz
* gephi (non R, open source)
* GoData (WHO initiative, check development status and licence)


## Available data
* simulated Ebola data in 'outbreaks'
* SL data (non public)
* Finlay's simulator
* Bertrand's Ebola data


## Team composition
* Maria Van Kerkhove
* Tom Crellen
